<h1 style="color:burlywood;text-align:center;">WESTERN WEAR</h1>
<h2 style="color:yellow;">have some westerns too to enjoy the vacations.Western wear is a category of men's and women's clothing which derives its unique style from the clothes worn in the 19th century Wild West. It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of pioneer, mountain man, Civil War, cowboy and vaquero clothing to the stylized garments popularized by singing cowboys such as Gene Autry and Roy Rogers in the 1940s and 1950s. Western wear can be very informal, with a t-shirt and blue jeans forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a cowboy hat, a leather belt, and cowboy boots.</h2>

<h1 style="color:blueviolet;text-align:center;">CHILDRENS WEAR</h1>
<p style="color:plum;"><em>children are our happiness.so let us make them happy with their favourite gm's kutty's wear in this festival season with exciting gifts.Baby books into the 1910s had space for mothers to note when their babies first wore "short clothes," but this time-honored transition from long white dresses to short ones was quickly becoming a thing of the past. By the 1920s, infants wore short, white dresses from birth to about six months with long dresses relegated to ceremonial wear as christening gowns. New babies continued to wear short dresses into the 1950s, although by this time, boys only did so for the first few weeks of their lives. </em></p>
